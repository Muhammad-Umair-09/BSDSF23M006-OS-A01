.TH WORDCOUNT 3 "September 22, 2025" "Version 0.4.1" "Library Functions"
.SH NAME
wordCount \- count lines, words and characters in a file stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
int wordCount(FILE *file, int *lines, int *words, int *chars);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads from the already-opened file stream **file** until EOF and counts:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The number of lines (incremented when '\n' is seen).
.IP "\(bu" 4
The number of words (a word is treated as a sequence of non-space characters;
transitions from whitespace to non-whitespace start a new word).
.IP "\(bu" 4
The number of characters (every character read increments the character count).
.PP

The function stores results into the integers pointed to by **lines**, **words**
and **chars**. All three pointers must be valid (non-NULL).

This function returns **0** on success. On error (for example if **file == NULL**
or one of the output pointers is NULL) it returns **-1**.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns **0** on success, **-1** on failure.

.SH NOTES
The function reads the stream until EOF and leaves the file position at EOF.
If the caller needs to reuse the same stream afterwards, call **rewind(file)** or
**fseek(file, 0, SEEK_SET)** after wordCount returns.

.SH EXAMPLE
.B
FILE *f = fopen("sample.txt", "r");
int L, W, C;
if (wordCount(f, &L, &W, &C) == 0) {
    printf("lines=%d words=%d chars=%d\n", L, W, C);
}
fclose(f);
