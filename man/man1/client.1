% CLIENT(1) Version 0.1.0 | OS Assignment - Multi-file Build

NAME
    client - a simple program demonstrating multi-file compilation and linking in C

SYNOPSIS
    ./bin/client

DESCRIPTION
    The 'client' executable is a simple program built as part of Feature 2 of the OS assignment.
    It demonstrates:
        - Organizing source files into multiple .c and .h files
        - Using a Makefile for compilation
        - Producing a single executable from multiple object files

    This version is compiled directly from all source files using the Makefile rule:

        $(TARGET): $(OBJECTS)

    which links all object files together to create the final binary.

OPTIONS
    This program does not accept command-line options in its current version.

EXAMPLES
    Compile the project:
        $ make

    Run the executable:
        $ ./bin/client
